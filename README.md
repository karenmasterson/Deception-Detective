Springboard Evaluator Jenny Hung's Feedback: 

"This is an awesome project!!! I especially like your considerations given to various ways to evaluate the performance of a predictive model, in addition to accuracy (such as speed, scalability, robustness, etc). Your code is also quite efficient and clean, and your report is written in a way that not only discusses your work, but also explains the technical points at an appropriate level. Great job again!"
